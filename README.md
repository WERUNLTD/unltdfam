All software things RVMR.Unltd

The code read in this repository is made with the intentions of Danian Bennett developing 
the source code and files for his company RVMR.Unltd's two products:
       (1) an open-source operating system called (U]os
       (2) an AR-native game-engine called (U]vision
       
As stated, it is open-source so input is gladly appreciated. 

Besides small projects and test applications, no official code for either product will be
released until, at the minimum, a working kernel is developed that can be dissected and
put back together by great minds to make the best possible product.

If you are a software dev who wants to do dope shit, be on fearless team and change the fucking
world, hmu. Co-founder spots are open for the radical few. 

much love,
Dame
